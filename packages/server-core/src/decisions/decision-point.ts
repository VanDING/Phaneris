/**
 * Host-side decision points.
 *
 * Every harness feature that asks the decision model something (task verdicts,
 * semantic labels, turn outcomes, ...) goes through `openDecisionPoint`:
 *
 *   1. resolve a client: Settings switch → the feature's toggle → key → endpoint;
 *   2. decide under the user's background deadline (`decisionLayer.deadlineMs`)
 *      unless the request sets its own;
 *   3. record every call (feature tag, question keys, answers, state hash, never
 *      the state itself);
 *   4. return `null` on any failure so the caller keeps its pre-decision behaviour;
 *   5. `recordDecisionOutcome(result, ...)` then records what the point did with the
 *      answer (an outcome line joined to the decision by id), so usage can be judged
 *      without re-deriving thresholds from the code; `recordDecisionFollowUp` adds what
 *      turned out later (was the suggested source used?), which is what tunes a threshold.
 *
 * A decision is advice for the host. It never grants authority.
