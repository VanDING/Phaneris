/**
 * Typed task verdicts via the decision model (Jev).
 *
 * The Conductor asks the orchestrator to end its verification reply with a
 * `VERDICT: PASS|FAIL` line. When the line is missing or garbled, the runner
 * used to re-ask (bounded) and eventually fail the run. With the decision layer
 * on, the reply is first classified by the decision model; only a confident
 * PASS/FAIL is accepted, everything else falls through to the old re-ask.
 *
 * Scope: parsing only. A parseable VERDICT line always wins over the model,
 * the model never changes what "PASS" or "FAIL" do, and `null` (unavailable,
 * unsure, failed) leaves the runner exactly as it was.
